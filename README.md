## 📖 About  
This repository contains the **Java projects** I built while completing the Udemy course [Practice Java by Building Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-java-by-building-projects/) by **Tim Short**.  

The goal of this course was to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts by developing real-world applications.
